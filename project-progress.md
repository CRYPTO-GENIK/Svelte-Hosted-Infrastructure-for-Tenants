# Project Progress

- Bootstrap the project using the latest versions of Svelte 5, SvelteKit, PocketBase, Tailwind, and modern design.
- Ensure the framework's README describes features and allows configuring a PocketBase URL as a constant for connecting and logging in.
- Standardize Master, Whitelabel, and End user roles so database collections can be generated and imported via a JSON generator with correct permissions.
- After forking the framework and logging in as superadmin, enable generation of pages for white label partners and their customers.
- Support whitelabel store services by creating front pages with customizable fields that partners can modify and use in Svelte templates.
- Provide a database import generator and Svelte template page generator so forkers can add pages, modify them, and add role-based menu items for partners and customers (e.g., Gold members vs. lower tiers).
